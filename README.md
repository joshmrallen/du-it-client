## Description
Du it! Du (读, pinyin: dú) is mandarin Chinese for "read."

I've been learning Chinese since 2007, graduated with a degree in Chinese, and lived in China for several years -- but my reading ability never feels right.

That's why I created Du it! It's a way to quickly define words without losing flow while reading.

Every word lookup gets added to a word list and a flashcard is created for you to test yourself.

### _Doesn't Kindle do that already?_

Yes, but I don't like the way Kindle does it. There's no pronunciation and there's no audio! What's more, the flashcard management is kind of annoying.
