# Adding sounds:
 - add icons to definition component
    - 2: one for each voice
    - word object will have male_voice and female_voice properties
    - values will be url to rails api
    - use with src attribute of Audio library in React
    - have onClick for each sound icon
    - use if statement in handler so we use one handler for both icons
